      <li>The Goku's legend starts at Paus Mountain. He arrived there as a tailed child; he was not human, neither he is, but he is a saiyan, an outsider human specie.</li>
      <li>His first human contact was made with the person who raised him, his grandfa Gohan. Gohan revealed later that Goku was really difficult child, his strenght and courage was unparallaled to other child of his age.</li>
      <li>One of his first enemies was Piccolo. Piccolo was a demon raised at the Earth, his will was to exterminate love and kindness from our planet. Goku defeated him succesfully.</li>
      <li>After defeating Piccolo, Goku became friend of Piccol1o's son, Piccolo Junior we may say. Goku and Piccolo bounded skills to defend our planet from the fears coming.</li>
      <li>Then we got the Saiyan Saga. Goku, Piccolo and their friends fought agains 3 Saiyans warriors. Raditz, the Goku's brother, Vegeta, the prince of the Saiyans, and Napa, Vegeta's subdite.</li>
      <li>The only saiyan survivor was Vegeta. And just like the last enemy goku fought, Vegeta and Goku became friends and bounded skills to fight the next enemy. Frieza, The Emperor,.</li>
      <li>Frieza was a galactic Emperor who used to conquer all the planets he could and take his habitants as slaves. That was the case with de Saiyan planet. Frieza destroyed it and now the only saiyan survivors are Goku and Vegeta.</li>
      <li>Goku and Vegeta revenged his planet and people and saved other planets from the Frieza's hand. One of the most important details form this saga is that Goku awakes the Super Saiyan, this s natural status of the saiyans where they can increase theis powers to fight.</li>
      <li>The coming enemies were fought at the Earth. They are Celll and Buu. They were the last enemies for the Goku story, according to Akira Toriyama, the Goku's creator.</li>
      <li>First was Cell, a kind of experiment developed with the only mission of defeating Goku and the rest of his friends, in order to control the whole society.</li>
      <li>In the other hand we have Buu. Buu was not a human enemy, but he was also an outsider. He came to our planet looking for power sources to finish his development.</li>
    <li>As you already know, Akira Toriyama is the mind behind this awesome tail.</li>

<p id="frase-akira" align="right">One of the biggest motaivations Akira found to write Dragon Ball was his enviroment. Japan after the Second World War was completely destroyed and bringing an stroy such as Dragon Ball would bring also ilussion and hapinness to all his generation.</p>

<p id="frase-akira"> If you have time and know some japanese, you can find here a web page dedicated only to <a href="http://bird.lemon-s.com/"> Akira Toriyama and his work.</a></p>
